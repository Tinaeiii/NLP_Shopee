Our team applied Python to analyze customer feedback data following their experience with the product “Đăk Lắk Coffee Scrub Body Exfoliating Pouch” on the Shopee e-commerce platform.
Through this, we gained insights into customer sentiments toward the product, helping businesses optimize and refine the product to better meet user needs.

Customer sentiment analysis enables businesses to consolidate and evaluate emotional expressions, identifying key business aspects as opportunities for improvement.
These emotional insights allow businesses to better understand and promote initiatives that enhance the customer experience, ultimately driving higher satisfaction and loyalty.
